# API

There are two variants to implement channels: `ReactiveChannel` and `ReactiveFunctionalChannel`.

:::tip
Use the first variant when you want to use your class for channels.

:::tip
Use the second variant when you want to implement only some functions using function objects.

## ReactiveChannel

```dart title="Declaration"
class ReactiveChannel {
  String get key
  ReactiveChannelConfiguration get configuration
  FutureOr<void> onPayload(dynamic payload, ReactiveProducer producer)
  FutureOr<void> onComplete(ReactiveProducer producer)
  FutureOr<void> onCancel(ReactiveProducer producer)
  FutureOr<void> onSubscribe(ReactiveProducer producer)
  FutureOr<void> onError(int code, String error, ReactiveProducer producer)
  FutureOr<void> onRequest(int count, ReactiveProducer producer)
}
```

## ReactiveFunctionalChannel

```dart title="Declaration"
class ReactiveFunctionalChannel with ReactiveChannel {
  final String key
  final ReactiveChannelConfiguration configuration
  final FutureOr<void> Function(dynamic payload, ReactiveProducer producer)? payloadConsumer
  final FutureOr<void> Function(ReactiveProducer producer)? subscribeConsumer
  final FutureOr<void> Function(int code, String error, ReactiveProducer producer)? errorConsumer
  final FutureOr<void> Function(int count, ReactiveProducer producer)? requestConsumer
  final FutureOr<void> Function(ReactiveProducer producer)? completeConsumer
  final FutureOr<void> Function(ReactiveProducer producer)? cancelConsumer

  ReactiveFunctionalChannel(
    this.key,
    this.configuration, {
    required this.payloadConsumer,
    required this.subscribeConsumer,
    required this.errorConsumer,
    required this.requestConsumer,
    required this.completeConsumer,
    required this.cancelConsumer,
  });

  FutureOr<void> onError(int code, String error, ReactiveProducer producer)
  FutureOr<void> onPayload(dynamic payload, ReactiveProducer producer)
  FutureOr<void> onRequest(int count, ReactiveProducer producer)
  FutureOr<void> onSubscribe(ReactiveProducer producer)
  FutureOr<void> onComplete(ReactiveProducer producer)
  FutureOr<void> onCancel(ReactiveProducer producer)
}
```

### Properties

#### key

#### onComplete

Called when a complete event was received.

#### onCancel
