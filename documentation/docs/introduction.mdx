# 👋 Hello

Greetings. Welcome to the documentation of the dart-reactive-transport (DRT) library.

The main purpose of this project is an implementation of the RSocket protocol over the IOUring transport in the Dart Language.

# 🧠 Reasoning

[RSocket](https://rsocket.io/) provides reactive communication between client and server over TCP.

The protocol contains these features:
* client and server two-sided channels
* backpressure
* lease
* graceful shutdown
* fragmentation
* multicodec
* resume

So I've decided to take [Dart network library](https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-iouring-transport) and implement RSocket channels over it.

# 🔨 Usage

1. Initiate a Dart project with `pubspec.yaml`.
2. Append the following section to your dependencies:
```yaml
  iouring_transport:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-iouring-transport/
      path: dart
  reactive_transport:
    git: 
      url: https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-reactive-transport/
```
3. Run `dart pub get`.
4. Refer to the [API](/category/-api) for implementation details. Enjoy!

# 💥 Samples

A basic sample of usage lives [here](https://github.com/antonbashir/dart-reactive-sample).

# ✋ Limitations

There are some features which I don't implement:
* resume and retry
* fire and forget, request-response, metadata push, request stream
* non-Linux platform - because of IOUring

Issues about wanted functions or existing bugs are always welcome.
